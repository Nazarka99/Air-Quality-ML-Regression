## Air-Quality-ML-Regression
### Overview
This repository contains a machine learning regression analysis of air quality data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this project is to predict air quality based on various input features.

### Data
The data used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains hourly measurements of various air pollutants and meteorological variables from a monitoring station in Italy.

### Methodology
The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook and the scikit-learn library. The data was preprocessed and cleaned before being fed into a regression model. Several approaches were used to deal with missing values in the data, including:
1. Replacing missing values with the mean value of the corresponding feature.
2. Deleting rows with missing values.
3. Using interpolation to fill in missing values.
4. Using linear interpolation to fill in missing values.

The performance of the model was evaluated using appropriate metrics.
