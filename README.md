### Air-Quality-ML-Regression
#### Overview
This repository contains a machine learning regression analysis of air quality data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this project is to predict air quality based on various input features.

#### Data
The data used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains hourly measurements of various air pollutants and meteorological variables from a monitoring station in Italy.

#### Methodology
The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook and the scikit-learn library. The data was preprocessed and cleaned before being fed into a regression model. The performance of the model was evaluated using appropriate metrics.
